1. Given a singly linked list of N nodes. The task is to find the middle of the linked list. For example, if the linked list is 1-> 2->3->4->5, then the middle node of the list is 3. If there are two middle nodes(in case, when N is even), print the second middle element.

2. Given a singly linked list. The task is to find the length of the linked list, where length is defined as the number of nodes in the linked list.

3. Given head, the head of a singly linked list, find if the linked list is circular or not. A linked list is called circular if it not NULL terminated and all nodes are connected in the form of a cycle. An empty linked list is considered as circular.

4. Given a sorted circular linked list, the task is to insert a new node in this circular list so that it remains a sorted circular linked list.

5. Given a singly linked list and a key, count the number of occurrences of given key in the linked list.
